## Redis Integration

The system uses Redis for:
- Asynchronous customer/order creation
- Delivery receipt processing
- Event-driven architecture

Key channels:
- `customer:create` - New customer events
- `order:create` - New order events
- `delivery:receipt` - Message delivery status updates

- Generates multiple variants and selects the best

### 2. Segment Rule Conversion
- Converts natural language ("customers who spent > $100 last month") to structured rules
- Supports complex logical operators (AND/OR)

### 3. Performance Analysis
- Automated campaign summaries
- Key insights and recommendations
- Human-readable performance reports
